## üìà Algorithm Analysis
### Time Complexity Analysis
- **Static Array**:
  - Insertion: \( O(1) \)
  - Deletion: \( O(n) \)
  - Traversal: \( O(n) \)
  
- **Dynamic Array**:
  - Insertion (with resizing): \( O(n) \), amortized \( O(1) \)
  - Deletion: \( O(n) \)
  - Traversal: \( O(n) \)

- **String Operations**:
  - Concatenation: \( O(m + n) \)
  - Substring: \( O(k) \)
  - Comparison: \( O(\min(m, n)) \)
  - Character Frequency: \( O(n) \)

### Recurrence Relations Analysis
- **Binary Search**:  
  \( T(n) = T(n/2) + O(1) \Rightarrow O(\log n) \)
- **Merge Sort**:  
  \( T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n) \Rightarrow O(n \log n) \)
