# Lab Assignment 3: Array Searching Operations

## Course Details
- **Program**: B.Tech Computer Science Engineering
- **Course Name**: Data Structures
- **Faculty**: Ms. Neetu Chauhan
- **Session**: 2024-2025

## Objectives
- Understand the basics of arrays and their operations.
- Implement searching algorithms such as Linear Search.
- Develop problem-solving skills with practical exercises.

## Learning Outcomes
- Ability to perform operations like accessing, inserting, and deleting elements in arrays.
- Gain hands-on experience in searching and sorting with arrays.
- Understand the role of arrays in efficient memory management.

## Tasks
1. **Linear Search in an Unsorted Array**
2. **Linear Search in a Sorted Array**

## Requirements
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)

## Usage
1. Compile the `main.cpp` file using:
   ```
   g++ main.cpp -o search
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```
   ./search
   ```

## Output
The program will output the position of the element if found, or indicate if the element is not found.
