# Data Structures Lab - Static and Dynamic Arrays, String Operations

## Overview
This project contains implementations of basic data structures:
- Static and Dynamic Arrays
- String Operations (concatenation, substring, comparison, character frequency)
- Analysis of time and space complexities using Big O notation.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler:
   ```
   g++ main.cpp -o main
   ```
3. Run the compiled program:
   ```
   ./main
   ```

## Test Cases
Refer to `test_cases.txt` for sample inputs and expected outputs.
